# Hi there! I'm Avansh Yadav ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer and open source enthusiast with a passion for creating innovative web applications. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, React and NextJs
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m excited to collaborate on projects that align with my interests and expertise:

- **Web Development**: Collaborations involving frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) or full-stack development with frameworks like React or Node.js.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Opportunities to contribute to meaningful open source projects, particularly those focusing on user interface design and performance.

Feel free to reach out if you have a project that matches these interests or if youâ€™d like to brainstorm ideas together!
